Known issues with the stuff in this branch
------------------------------------------

- mouse events aren't handled at all, so all the UIs which claim to support
  right-clicking to toggle between panes.. don't. I'd rather not use some
  pseudo-key hack, but haven't looked much at the other key-handling code yet.

- when switching from new UI to old, bits of the screen may not be
  redrawn correctly on local tiles. E.g. inv -> book -> spell -> memorize shows
  a blank sidebar, and probably others I'm forgetting

- descriptions with Xv draw the viewport centred on the player

- event handlers are currently attached to a slot called 'key_event': originally
  planned to have more, but this part of the API may need rethinking.
